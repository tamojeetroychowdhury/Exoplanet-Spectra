Spectral fitting with $\texttt{picaso}$ module. Project page - https://github.com/natashabatalha/picaso/tree/master

Configurations needed (on my side):
1. Download references folder from the module repo and keep it in same folder as script.
2. pip install xarray[complete], or xarray, netCDF4 and h5netcdf, https://docs.xarray.dev/en/stable/getting-started-guide/installing.html
